directly utilizing the related assets and services and to reflect how management assesses the cost of headcount in 2012. As a result, certain IT support
costs have been reclassified from operating expenses to cost of goods sold. All periods above has been reclassified to conform to current year

master distribution or resale agreement and an executed product license agreement from the end-user. For appliance sales, our
customary practice is to require a purchase order from distributors and resellers who have previously negotiated a master packaged
product distribution or resale agreement. We typically recognize revenue upon shipment for our appliance sales. For maintenance,
technical support, product training and consulting services, we require a purchase order and an executed agreement. For SaaS, we
generally require the customer or the reseller to electronically accept the terms of an online services agreement or execute a contract.	t360l58w525h9

have occurred when the related products are shipped and the end-user has been electronically provided the software activation keys that
allow the end-user to take immediate possession of the product. For hardware appliance sales, our standard delivery method is free-on-
board shipping point. Consequently, we consider delivery of appliances to have occurred when the products are shipped pursuant to an
agreement and purchase order. For SaaS, delivery occurs upon providing the users with their login id and password. For product training
and consulting services, we fulfill our obligation when the services are performed. For license updates, maintenance and technical
support, we assume that our obligation is satisfied ratably over the respective terms of the agreements, which are typically 12 to 24
months. For SaaS, we assume that our obligation is satisfied ratably over the respective terms of the agreements, which are typically 12

typically sell product licenses and license updates to distributors or resellers for whom there are histories of successful collection. New
customers are typically subject to a credit review process that evaluates their financial position and ultimately their ability to pay.
Customers are also subject to an ongoing credit review process.	t610l58w254h9

licensing agreements to have occurred when the related products are shipped and the end-user has been electronically provided the
software activation keys that allow the end-user to take immediate possession of the product. For hardware appliance sales, the
Company's standard delivery method is free-on-board shipping point. Consequently, it considers delivery of appliances to have
occurred when they are shipped pursuant to an agreement and purchase order. For SaaS, delivery occurs upon providing the users with
their login id and password. For product training and consulting services, the Company fulfills its obligation when the services are
performed. For license updates and maintenance, the Company assumes that its obligation is satisfied ratably over the respective terms
of the agreements, which are typically 12 to 24 months. For SaaS, the Company assumes that its obligation is satisfied ratably over the
respective terms of the agreements, which are typically 12 months.	t111l58w267h9

portion of their license fees or extended payment terms. The fees are considered fixed or determinable upon establishment of an
arrangement that contains the final terms of the sale including description, quantity and price of each product or service purchased. For
SaaS, the fee is considered fixed or determinable if it is not subject to refund or adjustment.	t222l58w364h9

table 60 page 79 row 2 col 1 to 2	Collectability is probable. The Company determines collectability on a customer-by-customer basis and generally does not require
collateral. The Company typically sells product licenses and license updates to distributors or resellers for whom there are histories of
successful collection. New customers are typically subject to a credit review process that evaluates their financial position and
ultimately their ability to pay. Customers are also subject to an ongoing credit review process. If the Company determines from the
outset of an arrangement that collectability is not probable, revenue recognition is deferred until customer payment is received and the
other parameters of revenue recognition described above have been achieved. Management's judgment is required in assessing the
probability of collection, which is generally based on an evaluation of customer specific information, historical experience and
economic market conditions.	t275l58w118h9
