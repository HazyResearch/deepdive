Matthew Settle,"Actor Matthew Settle, raised in Sevierville, has been keeping a secret, which has only recently been spilled to his family and a few select friends. The son of a Pigeon Forge preacher man got married six months ago...""I eloped,"" he says...""We got married quietly. She's from Israel""...He wasn't sure how his parents, conservative Baptists, would react to their son marrying a Jewish lady. ""I was afraid they'd be angry about it, but they were delighted,"" he says."
