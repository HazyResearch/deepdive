<p>A DeepDive applications generally consists of several phases:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Data Preparation</strong> - Set up the datastore and load initial data</li>

<li><strong>Feature Extraction</strong> - Write <em>extractors</em> to extract features from your data</li>

<li><strong>Probabilistic Inference</strong> - Write <em>inference rules</em> that describe how variables are related</li>

<li><strong>Calibration</strong> - Iterate on your feature extractors and inference rules</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="1_data_preparation">1. Data Preparation</h3>

<p>DeepDive assumes that you have initial data stored in a relational datastore, such as <a href="http://postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>. We hope to support different types of SQL- and NoSQL datastores in the future, but right now you are limited to Postgres. Loading initial data is not part of the DeepDive pipeline and should be done in a data preparation script. For an example of how such a script may look like, take a look at the examples that ship with Deepdive.</p>

<h3 id="2_feature_extraction">2. Feature Extraction</h3>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_extraction">Feature Extraction</a> is the process of transforming raw data into a set of <em>features</em> that capture important information about the data. The goal of the feature extraction step is to extract useful features that can be used during probabilistic inference.</p>

<p>DeepDive provides an abstraction called <em>extractors</em> for this purpose. Each extractor takes JSON tuples as input, and produces JSON tuples as output. One can think of an extractor as a function whichs maps one input tuple to one or more output tuples, similar to a <code>map</code> or <code>flatMap</code> function in common programming languages. The output of an extractor is written back to the data store, and can be used in other extractors and/or during the inference step.</p>

<p>In DeepDive, extractors are arbitary executable files, and can be written in any programming language. For example, one could write an extractor that extracts words form a sentence in Python as follows:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='python'><span class='c'>#! /usr/bin/env python</span>

<span class='kn'>import</span> <span class='nn'>fileinput</span>
<span class='kn'>import</span> <span class='nn'>json</span>

<span class='c'># For each input row</span>
<span class='k'>for</span> <span class='n'>line</span> <span class='ow'>in</span> <span class='n'>fileinput</span><span class='o'>.</span><span class='n'>input</span><span class='p'>():</span>
  <span class='c'># Load the JSON object</span>
  <span class='n'>row</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='n'>json</span><span class='o'>.</span><span class='n'>loads</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='n'>line</span><span class='p'>)</span>
  <span class='k'>if</span> <span class='n'>row</span><span class='p'>[</span><span class='s'>&quot;titles.title&quot;</span><span class='p'>]</span> <span class='ow'>is</span> <span class='ow'>not</span> <span class='bp'>None</span><span class='p'>:</span>
    <span class='c'># Split the sentence by space</span>
    <span class='k'>for</span> <span class='n'>word</span> <span class='ow'>in</span> <span class='nb'>set</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='n'>row</span><span class='p'>[</span><span class='s'>&quot;titles.title&quot;</span><span class='p'>]</span><span class='o'>.</span><span class='n'>split</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='s'>&quot; &quot;</span><span class='p'>)):</span>
      <span class='c'># Output the word</span>
      <span class='k'>print</span> <span class='n'>json</span><span class='o'>.</span><span class='n'>dumps</span><span class='p'>({</span>
        <span class='s'>&quot;title_id&quot;</span><span class='p'>:</span> <span class='nb'>int</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='n'>row</span><span class='p'>[</span><span class='s'>&quot;titles.id&quot;</span><span class='p'>]),</span> 
        <span class='s'>&quot;word&quot;</span><span class='p'>:</span> <span class='n'>word</span>
      <span class='p'>})</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="3_probabilistic_inference">3. Probabilistic Inference</h3>

<p>The goal of inference is to make predictions on a set of <em>variables</em>. For example, you may want to predict whether or not a person has cancer based on a number of symptoms (features). DeepDive uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_graph">factor graphs</a>, a type of graphical model, to perform probabilistic inference. On a high-level, a factor graph has two types of nodes:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Variables</em>, which are called <em>evidence variables</em> when their value is known, or <em>query varibles</em> when their value should be predicted. <em>Evidence variables</em> can be used as training data to learn weights for factors.</li>

<li><em>Factors</em> define how variables in the graph are related to each other. Each factor can be connected to many variables, and uses a <em>factor function</em> to define the relationship between these variables. Each <em>factor function</em> has a <em>weight</em> associated with it, which describes how much influence the factor has on its variables in relative terms. The weight can be learned from training data, or assigned manually.</li>
</ul>

<p>While you don’t need to be initimately familiar with factor graphs to be able to use DeepDive, it is a good idea to have a basic understanding of how they work. A few good resources can be found here:</p>

<li><a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/people/chrismre/papers/elementary_sigmod.pdf">Towards High-Throughput Gibbs Sampling at Scale: A Study across Storage Managers</a></li>

<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1005.1934v1.pdf">Scalable Probabilistic Databases with Factor Graphs and MCMC</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/pgm">PGM class on Coursera</a></li>
</ul>

<p>DeepDive exposes a language to easily build factor graphs by writing <em>rules</em> that define the relationships between varibles.</p>

<pre><code>smokesFactor.input_query: &quot;SELECT * from people&quot;
smokesFactor.function: &quot;people.has_cancer = Imply(people.smokes)&quot;
smokesFactor.weight: ?</code></pre>

<p>For example, the rule above states that if a person smokes, he or she is likely to have cancer, and that the weight of the rule should be learned automatically based on training data. You can use DeepDive’s language to express complex relationships that use features which you have previously extracted.</p>

<h3 id="4_calibration">4. Calibration</h3>

<p>Writing factors and rules is an iterative process. You may find that a certain rule does not work as well as expected, or that you need to extract more features. DeepDive wants to make this process as easy as possible, so it writes <em>calibration data</em>, which helps you to figure out where the bottlenecks in your system are.</p>
