# Changelog for version 0.02-alpha (03/12/2014)

- **Non-backward-compatible syntax change**: Extractors only use the column name instead of \[relation_name\].\[column_name\] for keys to the JSON object. Documentation has been updated appropriately.
- **Non-backward-compatible syntax change**: You must explicitly alias id and variable columns in the inference rules. See the updated inference rule documentation for more information
- Faster factor graph grounding code using pure SQL
- Support for high-speed C++ sampler
- Added documentation for high-speed sampler integration
- Faster serialization of factor graph
