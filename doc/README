Maintaining DeepDive website
============================

## Testing Locally

If you want to make changes, BE SURE TO TEST LOCALLY, and do a "git push" first
and wait for the travis test to pass before you run "make deploy".

To test the docs locally, be sure to have dependency `jekyll` installed via
`gem install jekyll`. Then under DEEPDIVE_HOME/doc/:

    make test


## Checking Links

This will host the docs on your http://localhost:4000. Keep it hosted, and open
a new terminal, navigate into DEEPDIVE_HOME/src/test/bash/, then run:

    ./linkcheck.sh http://localhost:4000 --check-extern

This will do a BETTER test than the travis one since it also checks external
links. We have not figured out a good way to do this on Travis, since it
occasionally suffers from a timeout problem.  Ideally you will find the output
like:

    [Thu Apr 16 11:28:04 PDT 2015] No errors found.


## Deploying to deepdive.stanford.edu

When all the tests are passed, you can run:

    make deploy DEPLOY_USER=[yourUserName]

where [yourUserName] is your account to log into our server that hosts
deepdive.


## Deploying to a Different URL

To deploy the website at a different URL, e.g., under your personal homepage
for asking review by others, you can tweak the DEPLOY_USER_HOST, DEPLOY_DIR,
and WEBSITE_BASEURL variables.

For example, to deploy to a temporary directory under your personal
cs.stanford.edu page, run:

    make deploy \
      DEPLOY_USER_HOST=whale.stanford.edu \
      DEPLOY_DIR=www/tmp/deepdive \
      WEBSITE_BASEURL=http://cs.stanford.edu/~$USER/tmp/deepdive

As another example, the following command will deploy under your Stanford's
personal web page:

    make deploy \
      DEPLOY_USER_HOST=cardinal.stanford.edu \
      DEPLOY_DIR=WWW/tmp/deepdive \
      WEBSITE_BASEURL=http://web.stanford.edu/~$USER/tmp/deepdive
